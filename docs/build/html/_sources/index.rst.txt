Introduction
------------

FIESTA is a python library for general interpolation from uniform and non-uniform
input points. The library is predominantly written in python with a backend of
Fortran for speed.

MPI functionality can be enabled through the installation of the python library
mpi4py but will require the additional installation of MPIutils which handles
all of the MPI enabled functions. The class MPI is passed as an additional argument
for parallelisation.


Dependencies
------------

FIESTA is being developed in Python 3.8 but should work on all versions >3.4. FIESTA
is written mostly in python but the heavy computation is carried out in Fortran.
Compiling the Fortran source code will require the availability of a fortran compiler
usually gfortran (which comes with gcc).

The following Python modules are required.

* `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
* `scipy <https://scipy.org/>`_
* `SHIFT <https://github.com/knaidoo29/SHIFT>`_

For testing you will require `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ or
`pytest <http://pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ .


Installation
------------

FIESTA can be installed by cloning the github repository::

    git clone https://github.com/knaidoo29/FIESTA.git
    cd FIESTA
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

Once this is done you should be able to call FIESTA from python:

.. code-block:: python

    import fiesta
